# A/B Testing Landing Pages with Firebase & Next.js: Playbook

This playbook guides you through setting up and running A/B tests for your SecureTomorrow landing page using Firebase Remote Config and Next.js.

## 1. Introduction to A/B Testing

A/B testing (or split testing) is a method of comparing two or more versions of a webpage or app feature to determine which one performs better. In our case, we'll use it to test different variations of the landing page content (e.g., headlines, CTAs) to optimize for conversions.

**Firebase Tools Used:**
- **Firebase Remote Config:** Allows you to change the behavior and appearance of your app without publishing an app update. We'll use it to control which landing page variation a user sees.
- **Firebase Hosting:** (Implicitly used) To host your Next.js application.
- **Firebase A/B Testing:** A Firebase feature that helps you run, analyze, and scale product and marketing experiments.

## 2. Prerequisites

### 2.1. Firebase Project Setup
- Ensure you have a Firebase project created. If not, create one at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Your project should have Billing enabled if you plan to use Firebase A/B Testing features extensively, though Remote Config itself has a generous free tier.

### 2.2. Add Firebase to Your Next.js App
- The project is already configured with the Firebase SDK. The initialization logic is in `src/lib/firebase.ts`.
- **Crucially, you must create a `.env.local` file** in the root of your project. Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if it exists, otherwise create it from scratch) into `.env.local` and replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project's configuration credentials. You can find these in your Firebase project settings (Project Overview > Project settings > General > Your apps > SDK setup and configuration).
  Example `.env.local` content:
  ```env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=1234567890
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:1234567890:web:abcdef123456
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-ABCDEFGHIJ
  ```
- **Important:** After creating or modifying `.env.local`, you **MUST restart your Next.js development server** (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`) for the changes to take effect.

## 3. Setting up Landing Page Variations in Code

The application is set up to allow variations in the Hero Section of the landing page.

### 3.1. How it Works
- **`src/lib/firebase.ts`**: Initializes the Firebase app and Remote Config. It sets default values for Remote Config parameters.
- **`src/hooks/useRemoteConfigValue.ts`**: This custom React hook fetches a specified parameter's value from Firebase Remote Config. It handles loading states and uses default values if the fetch fails or if the app is running server-side.
- **`src/app/page.tsx`**: The main landing page component uses `useRemoteConfigValue` to fetch a configuration object for the hero section (parameter key: `heroConfig`).
- **`src/components/landing/HeroSection.tsx`**: This component now accepts props (`headline`, `subHeadline`, `ctaText`) that are dynamically set based on the `heroConfig` fetched from Remote Config.

### 3.2. Current Configurable Elements
The `heroConfig` parameter in Remote Config should be a JSON string with the following structure:
```json
{
  "headline": "Your Catchy Headline Here",
  "subHeadline": "(Your compelling sub-headline)",
  "ctaText": "Your Call to Action Text"
}
```

### 3.3. Creating New Variations
To test different Hero Section content:
1.  You don't need to change the Next.js code if you're just changing the text content for `headline`, `subHeadline`, or `ctaText`. You will define these variations in Firebase Remote Config (see next section).
2.  If you want to test more structural changes or different components, you would:
    *   Modify `HeroSection.tsx` or create new components.
    *   Update `src/app/page.tsx` to conditionally render these based on a different Remote Config parameter or a more complex `heroConfig` structure.

## 4. Configuring Firebase Remote Config

### 4.1. Access Remote Config
- Go to your Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
- In the left-hand navigation pane, under the "Engage" section (or "Build" in newer UIs), click on **Remote Config**.

### 4.2. Define the `heroConfig` Parameter
1.  Click **"Add parameter"** or **"Create configuration"**.
2.  **Parameter key:** Enter `heroConfig`.
3.  **Data type:** Select **String**. (Remote Config will store our JSON configuration as a string).
4.  **Default value (server-side):** This is the value used if the app can't fetch a value for a user (e.g., first load, offline).
    - For the control/baseline version, paste the following JSON string:
      ```json
      {"headline":"Ensure Your Family's Financial Security","subHeadline":"(even when you can't be there for them)","ctaText":"Secure My Family's Future Now"}
      ```
5.  Click **"Save"**.

### 4.3. Add Variations as Conditional Values (for A/B Testing)
You typically don't set multiple values directly here if you are using Firebase A/B Testing. The A/B Testing tool will override the default value for users in specific experiment variants.

However, you *could* add conditional values for testing or specific user segments directly in Remote Config:
1.  Click on the `heroConfig` parameter to edit it.
2.  Click **"Add new conditional value"**.
3.  Define a condition (e.g., "User in audience," "Country/region").
4.  Set the value for that condition. For example, for a "Variant A" headline:
    ```json
    {"headline":"Unlock Financial Peace of Mind","subHeadline":"(protecting your loved ones, always)","ctaText":"Get Protected Today"}
    ```
5.  Save the conditional value.

### 4.4. Publish Changes
- After defining your parameter and any initial values, click **"Publish changes"** in the Remote Config dashboard. Changes might take a few minutes to propagate.

## 5. Deploying Your App
- Ensure your Next.js application (with the Firebase SDK and Remote Config logic) is deployed to Firebase Hosting or your preferred hosting platform.
  ```bash
  # If using Firebase CLI for hosting
  firebase deploy --only hosting
  ```

## 6. Creating an A/B Test in Firebase Console

This is where you define your experiment to test different `heroConfig` values.

### 6.1. Navigate to A/B Testing
- In the Firebase Console, under the "Engage" section, click on **A/B Testing**.

### 6.2. Set Up a New Experiment
1.  Click **"Create experiment"**.
2.  Choose **Remote Config**.
3.  **Basics:**
    *   **Name:** Give your experiment a descriptive name (e.g., "Hero Headline Test - Q3").
    *   **Description:** (Optional) Add more details.
4.  **Targeting:**
    *   **Target users:** Typically, you'll target "All users" or a percentage of your users.
    *   **Activation event:** `first_open` is common for app-wide configs, meaning the config is applied when the user first opens the app (or a session starts). For web, this often means on page load.
    *   You can add other criteria like app version, user properties, etc.
5.  **Goals:**
    *   **Primary metric:** Select what you want to optimize for (e.g., a custom conversion event like `form_submission_successful`, or built-in metrics like retention or crash-free users). You might need to set up Analytics events first.
    *   **Additional metrics:** Add other metrics to monitor.
6.  **Variants:**
    *   **Baseline:** This is your control group. It will typically use the default value of your Remote Config parameter or you can specify it.
        *   Parameter: Select `heroConfig`.
        *   Value: (Usually leave as "Use parameter's default value" or explicitly set the control JSON string).
    *   **Variant A:** (and B, C, etc. as needed)
        *   Click **"Add variant"**.
        *   Name your variant (e.g., "New Headline CTA").
        *   Parameter: `heroConfig`.
        *   Value: Enter the JSON string for this variation. For example:
          ```json
          {"headline":"Unlock Financial Peace of Mind","subHeadline":"(protecting your loved ones, always)","ctaText":"Get Protected Today"}
          ```
    *   **Distribution:** Adjust the percentage of users who will see each variant. Often, it's an equal split (e.g., 50% Baseline, 50% Variant A).
7.  Click **"Review"** and then **"Start experiment"**.

### 6.3. Monitor and Analyze
- Once the experiment is running, Firebase will collect data. You can monitor its progress and results in the A/B Testing dashboard.
- After enough data is collected, Firebase will help you determine if there's a statistically significant winner.

## 7. Iterating and Adding New Variations

1.  **Hypothesize:** What do you want to improve? What change might achieve that?
2.  **Code (if needed):** If your new variation requires structural changes beyond text, update your Next.js components.
3.  **Remote Config:** Define the new JSON string for your `heroConfig` variation.
4.  **A/B Test:**
    *   You can duplicate an existing experiment and modify the variants.
    *   Or create a new experiment.
5.  **Deploy:** Ensure your app code is deployed.

## 8. Best Practices

- **Clear Hypothesis:** Start every test with a clear idea of what you're testing and why.
- **One Major Change at a Time:** This makes it easier to attribute performance changes to specific modifications.
- **Sufficient Sample Size & Duration:** Run tests long enough to get statistically significant results. Firebase will often guide you on this.
- **Meaningful Metrics:** Track metrics that align with your business goals.
- **Test in Development:** Before launching an A/B test to all users, ensure your variations work correctly by targeting your test devices or using conditional values in Remote Config.

## 9. Troubleshooting

- **Error: `FirebaseError: Installations: Missing App configuration value: "projectId"` (or similar missing config values)**
    *   **Cause:** This is the most common issue and means your Firebase SDK is not getting the necessary configuration (like `projectId`, `apiKey`, etc.) when it tries to initialize.
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  **Check `.env.local`:** Ensure you have a `.env.local` file in the **root directory** of your Next.js project.
        2.  **Correct Credentials:** Make sure this file contains the correct Firebase credentials, prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. For example:
            ```
            NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
            NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id
            NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-actual-project-id.firebaseapp.com
            NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:your-app-id:web:abcdef12345
            ```
        3.  **Restart Server:** After creating or modifying `.env.local`, you **MUST restart your Next.js development server** (stop it and run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` again). Next.js only loads environment variables at build/startup time.
    *   The file `src/lib/firebase.ts` has been updated to provide more detailed console warnings if it detects missing configuration, which can help pinpoint the issue.

- **Remote Config Values Not Updating:**
    *   **Publishing:** Ensure you've clicked "Publish changes" in the Firebase Remote Config console.
    *   **Fetch Interval:** Remote Config has a fetch interval. In development, `minimumFetchIntervalMillis` is set low (e.g., 10 seconds in `src/lib/firebase.ts`). In production, it's higher (e.g., 1 hour). Forcing an app restart or clearing browser cache might help during testing.
    *   **Caching:** Firebase SDKs cache values. The `fetchAndActivate` function helps ensure fresh values are fetched and applied.
    *   **Default Values:** If `useRemoteConfigValue` consistently returns the default value you passed to it, it might indicate an issue fetching from Remote Config (check console for errors from `src/lib/firebase.ts` or `src/hooks/useRemoteConfigValue.ts`).

- **A/B Test Not Starting/No Data:**
    *   Ensure your app is correctly fetching and applying Remote Config values.
    *   Check that the activation event for your A/B test (e.g., `first_open`) is firing correctly. For web apps, this often translates to page loads or initial user interactions.
    *   Verify that Firebase Analytics is correctly integrated and logging events, especially your goal metrics.

This playbook should provide a solid foundation for conducting A/B tests on your SecureTomorrow landing page. Good luck!
