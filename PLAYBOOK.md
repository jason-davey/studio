# A/B Testing Landing Pages with Firebase & Next.js: Playbook

This playbook guides you through setting up and running A/B tests for your SecureTomorrow landing page using Firebase Remote Config and Next.js, with the help of an in-app A/B Test Configurator tool that includes AI-powered content suggestions.

## 1. Introduction to A/B Testing

A/B testing (or split testing) is a method of comparing two or more versions of a webpage or app feature to determine which one performs better. In our case, we'll use it to test different variations of the landing page content (e.g., headlines, CTAs) to optimize for conversions.

**Firebase Tools Used:**
- **Firebase Remote Config:** Allows you to change the behavior and appearance of your app without publishing an app update. We'll use it to control which landing page variation a user sees.
- **Firebase Hosting:** (Implicitly used) To host your Next.js application.
- **Firebase A/B Testing:** A Firebase feature that helps you run, analyze, and scale product and marketing experiments.

## 2. Prerequisites

### 2.1. Firebase Project Setup
- Ensure you have a Firebase project created. If not, create one at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Your project should have Billing enabled if you plan to use Firebase A/B Testing features extensively, though Remote Config itself has a generous free tier.
- Ensure Genkit AI models (like Gemini via Google AI plugin) are configured if you intend to use the AI suggestion features and are outside any free quotas or need specific project billing.

### 2.2. Add Firebase to Your Next.js App
- The project is already configured with the Firebase SDK. The initialization logic is in `src/lib/firebase.ts`.
- **Crucially, you must create a `.env.local` file** in the root of your project. Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if it exists, otherwise create it from scratch) into `.env.local` and replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project's configuration credentials. You can find these in your Firebase project settings (Project Overview > Project settings > General > Your apps > SDK setup and configuration).
  Example `.env.local` content:
  ```env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=1234567890
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:1234567890:web:abcdef123456
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-ABCDEFGHIJ
  ```
- **Important:** After creating or modifying `.env.local`, you **MUST restart your Next.js development server** (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`) for the changes to take effect.

## 3. Setting up Landing Page Variations in Code

The application is set up to allow variations in the Hero Section of the landing page. The main page of the application (`/`) is now an A/B Test Configurator tool. A side-by-side A/B test preview page is available at `/landing-preview`.

### 3.1. How it Works
- **`src/lib/firebase.ts`**: Initializes the Firebase app and Remote Config. It sets default values for a `heroConfig` Remote Config parameter.
- **`/` (root) page (A/B Test Configurator & Manager Tool)**: This tool allows you to define two versions (A and B) of hero section content.
    - **Campaign Focus Input:** For each version (A and B), you can optionally provide text in the "Campaign Focus / Keywords" textarea. This text will guide the AI when generating suggestions, making them more relevant to your specific campaign, audience, or keywords.
    - **AI Content Suggestions:** You can use the "✨ Suggest with AI" buttons next to input fields to get AI-generated ideas for headlines, sub-headlines, and CTAs. These suggestions will be tailored if you've provided text in the "Campaign Focus" field.
    - **Local Configuration Management:** You can save, load, and delete named configurations (e.g., "Spring Campaign Hero") in your browser's local storage. The "Campaign Focus" text *is also saved* as part of these configurations, allowing you to maintain context for future AI suggestions if you reload a saved configuration.
    - **JSON Generation:** The tool automatically generates the JSON string for each version (for the `heroConfig` which includes headline, subHeadline, ctaText).
    - **Preview:** Click "Render Pages for Preview" to see Version A and B side-by-side on the `/landing-preview` page.
- **`/landing-preview` page**: This page shows a side-by-side preview of two HeroSection configurations, dynamically passed from the A/B Test Configurator tool via URL parameters.
- **`src/components/landing/HeroSection.tsx`**: This component accepts props (`headline`, `subHeadline`, `ctaText`) that can be dynamically set.

### 3.2. Configurable Elements
The `heroConfig` parameter in Remote Config (or the JSON generated by the tool) should be a JSON string with the following structure:
```json
{
  "headline": "Your Catchy Headline Here",
  "subHeadline": "(Your compelling sub-headline)",
  "ctaText": "Your Call to Action Text"
}
```
The "Campaign Focus / Keywords" text you provide in the configurator is used to guide the AI content suggestions and *is also saved locally* with your configurations for future use, but it is *not* part of the `heroConfig` JSON that gets sent to Firebase.

### 3.3. Preparing New Variations (Using the A/B Test Configurator Tool)
To test different Hero Section content:
1.  Navigate to the root of your application (e.g., `http://localhost:9002/`). This is the **A/B Test Configurator & Manager Tool**.
2.  Use the "Version A" and "Version B" forms to input the headline, sub-headline, and CTA text for each variation.
    - **Optional Campaign Focus:** For each version, you can enter text into the "Campaign Focus / Keywords" textarea. This helps the AI generate more targeted suggestions. For example, you might enter "focus on young families" or "highlight 10% cash back reward".
    - **Optional AI Assistance:** Click the "✨ Suggest with AI" button next to any field to get AI-generated suggestions. If you've provided Campaign Focus, these suggestions will be tailored to it. You can use these as a starting point or for inspiration.
3.  **Local Management (Optional but Recommended):**
    - Before or after inputting content, you can save the current state of Version A or B (headline, sub-headline, CTA, and campaign focus).
    - Enter a descriptive name in the "Save Version ... Content As:" field (e.g., "Summer Sale Headline Test A").
    - Click the "Save Content" button for that version.
    - Saved configurations will appear in the "Managed Hero Configurations" list, allowing you to load them back into Version A or B forms later (including the campaign focus).
4.  The tool will automatically display the generated JSON string for each version (Version A and Version B currently in the forms).
5.  You can **Copy** or **Download** the JSON for each version. This JSON will be used in Firebase Remote Config.
6.  Click the **"Render Pages for Preview"** button. This will open the `/landing-preview` page with both Version A and Version B (as currently configured in the forms) displayed side-by-side for visual review.
7.  If you need to make structural changes to the `HeroSection` component itself (beyond text), you would:
    *   Modify `HeroSection.tsx` or create new components.
    *   Adjust how the configurations are used if the structure of the JSON needs to change.

### 3.4. Branding Considerations for Test Variations
When designing new content variations for your A/B tests, ensure they align with the established brand identity. Key elements to consider are:

*   **Brand Colors (from Visual Identity Guide):**
    *   Greenstone Real Purple: `#912680` (Often used as a primary brand color)
    *   Greenstone Choosi Blue: `#003753` (A strong secondary or accent color)
    *   Greenstone GFS Green: `#00a77f` (Can be used for accents or specific calls to action)
    *   Greenstone Shine Yellow: `#ffc40c` (Excellent for highlights and prominent CTAs)
    *   Refer to your full brand guidelines for other colors like GFS Purple (`#4f2d7f`) and Grey (`#4d4d4d`).
*   **Font:**
    *   The project uses **URW DIN** as its primary font. Ensure all text content in your variations maintains this typography for consistency.
*   **Logo Usage:**
    *   The application's logo is located at `/public/resources/logo.png`. Ensure its presentation is consistent if your variations affect the header or areas where the logo might appear.

Maintaining brand consistency across test variations is crucial for a professional user experience, even while experimenting with messaging and CTAs.

## 4. Configuring Firebase Remote Config

### 4.1. Access Remote Config
- Go to your Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
- In the left-hand navigation pane, under the "Engage" section (or "Build" in newer UIs), click on **Remote Config**.

### 4.2. Define the `heroConfig` Parameter
1.  Click **"Add parameter"** or **"Create configuration"**.
2.  **Parameter key:** Enter `heroConfig`.
3.  **Data type:** Select **String**.
4.  **Default value (server-side):** This is your **control/baseline** version.
    - Use the **A/B Test Configurator & Manager Tool** (root `/` path) to generate the JSON for your baseline/control version (e.g., by filling out "Version A" with your baseline content and copying its JSON).
    - Paste the generated JSON here. For example:
      ```json
      {"headline":"Ensure Your Family's Financial Security","subHeadline":"(even when you can't be there for them)","ctaText":"Secure My Family's Future Now"}
      ```
5.  Click **"Save"**.

### 4.3. Adding Variations for an A/B Test in Firebase
You will define your variations when creating an A/B test (see Section 6). The A/B Testing tool will override the default `heroConfig` value for users in specific experiment variants. You will use the JSON generated by the **A/B Test Configurator & Manager Tool** for each variant.

### 4.4. Publish Changes
- After defining your parameter and its default value in the Firebase Console, click **"Publish changes"** in the Remote Config dashboard. Changes might take a few minutes to propagate.

## 5. Deploying Your App
- Ensure your Next.js application (with the Firebase SDK and updated pages) is deployed to Firebase Hosting or your preferred hosting platform.
  ```bash
  # If using Firebase CLI for hosting
  firebase deploy --only hosting
  ```

## 6. Creating an A/B Test in Firebase Console

This is where you define your experiment to test different `heroConfig` values against each other for your actual users.

### 6.1. Navigate to A/B Testing
- In the Firebase Console, under the "Engage" section, click on **A/B Testing**.

### 6.2. Set Up a New Experiment
1.  Click **"Create experiment"**.
2.  Choose **Remote Config**.
3.  **Basics:**
    *   **Name:** Give your experiment a descriptive name (e.g., "Hero Headline Test - Q3").
    *   **Description:** (Optional) Add more details.
4.  **Targeting:**
    *   **Target users:** Typically, you'll target "All users" or a percentage of your users.
    *   **Activation event:** `first_open` is common for app-wide configs. For web, this often means on page load for pages that utilize this config.
5.  **Goals:**
    *   **Primary metric:** Select what you want to optimize for (e.g., a custom conversion event like `form_submission_successful`).
6.  **Variants:**
    *   **Baseline:** This is your control group.
        *   Parameter: Select `heroConfig`.
        *   Value: It should typically use the "parameter's default value" (which you set in step 4.2 using the JSON from "Version A" or your designated control from the configurator tool).
    *   **Variant A (or your experimental variant):**
        *   Click **"Add variant"**.
        *   Name your variant (e.g., "New Headline CTA").
        *   Parameter: `heroConfig`.
        *   Value: Use the **A/B Test Configurator & Manager Tool** (root `/` path) to generate the JSON string for this experimental variation (e.g., by filling out "Version B" in the tool and copying its JSON). Paste the JSON here. For example:
          ```json
          {"headline":"Unlock Financial Peace of Mind","subHeadline":"(protecting your loved ones, always)","ctaText":"Get Protected Today"}
          ```
    *   **Distribution:** Adjust the percentage of users who will see each variant.
7.  Click **"Review"** and then **"Start experiment"**.

### 6.3. Monitor and Analyze
- Monitor progress in the A/B Testing dashboard. Firebase will help determine a statistically significant winner.

## 7. Iterating and Adding New Variations

1.  **Hypothesize:** What do you want to improve?
2.  **Generate JSONs:** Use the A/B Test Configurator & Manager Tool (root `/` path) to create content for "Version A" and "Version B" (using Campaign Focus and AI suggestions if desired). Click "Render Pages for Preview" to compare them visually on the `/landing-preview` page.
3.  **Download/Copy JSON:** For the version you want to use as your new experimental variant in Firebase, copy or download its JSON.
4.  **A/B Test Setup:** In Firebase A/B Testing, create a new experiment or edit an existing one, pasting the new JSON for the relevant variant.
5.  **Deploy (if code changes were made):** If your new variation required structural changes beyond text (not handled by the current tool), deploy your app code.

## 8. Best Practices

- **Clear Hypothesis.**
- **One Major Change at a Time** (if not using a multivariate testing tool).
- **Sufficient Sample Size & Duration.**
- **Meaningful Metrics.**
- **Test in Development:** Use the A/B Test Configurator and the `/landing-preview` page to thoroughly review your variations before setting up a live experiment in Firebase.

## 9. Troubleshooting

- **Error: `FirebaseError: Installations: Missing App configuration value: "projectId"` (or similar missing config values)**
    *   **Cause:** Firebase SDK not getting necessary configuration.
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  Ensure `.env.local` exists in the project root.
        2.  Ensure correct Firebase credentials (prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) are in `.env.local`.
        3.  **Restart your Next.js development server** after changes to `.env.local`.
    *   `src/lib/firebase.ts` provides console warnings for missing config.

- **Remote Config Values Not Updating (for a live page using `useRemoteConfigValue`):**
    *   Ensure "Publish changes" in Firebase Remote Config console.
    *   Note fetch intervals (dev vs. prod). Forcing app restart or clearing cache might help during testing.

- **A/B Test Not Starting/No Data:**
    *   Ensure your app correctly fetches and applies Remote Config values (if a live page is consuming it).
    *   Check activation event for your A/B test.
    *   Verify Firebase Analytics integration.

- **Preview Page (`/landing-preview`) Not Showing Correct Content:**
    *   Ensure you clicked "Render Pages for Preview" from the main configurator tool (`/`).
    *   Check the URL of the preview page for `configA` and `configB` query parameters.
    *   Check the browser console on the preview page for any JSON parsing errors.
    *   Ensure the JSON generated by the configurator is valid.

- **AI Suggestions Not Working:**
    *   Check the browser console for any errors when clicking the "Suggest with AI" buttons.
    *   Ensure your Genkit development server is running if you are testing locally (`npm run genkit:dev`).
    *   Verify that your Firebase project (and potentially Google Cloud project if using billable Gemini features) is correctly set up for Genkit and the Google AI plugin. Check for any API key or authentication issues if applicable.
    *   Try providing specific text in the "Campaign Focus / Keywords" textarea to see if it helps the AI generate more relevant suggestions. If the AI is struggling with very broad or no input, giving it a theme can significantly improve results.

This playbook should provide a solid foundation for conducting A/B tests on your SecureTomorrow landing page. Good luck!
